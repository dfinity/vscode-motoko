- `dfx`

## Extension Commands

This extension contributes the following commands:

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `motoko.dfx`: The location of the `dfx` binary
- `motoko.canister`: By default we'll let you choose what canister defined in your project you want to use, use this setting to change that to a specific one
- `motoko.standaloneArguments`: Additional arguments to pass to the language service when running in a non-dfx project
- `motoko.standaloneBinary`: The location of the `mo-ide` binary (when running in a non-dfx project)

## Contributing

When hacking on the extension you can package your local version by running:

```bash
npm install
npm run package
```

This should leave you with a `vscode-motoko-x.x.x.vsix` file in the project root.

Next run `code --install-extension vscode-motoko-x.x.x.vsix` to install your development version. If this doesn't work, you can also use the VSCode UI to install from a local `.vsix` file.
